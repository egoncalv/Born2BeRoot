# Born2BeRoot
## This projects aims to introduce the world of virtualization.
## It consists in creating a Virtual Machine in VirtualBox (or UTM) under specific instructions. At the end of this project we should be fully comfortable with the concept of Virtualization, as well as dealing with command-line based systems, partitioning memory with LVM, setting up SSH ports, MACs, Firewalls, among many other important concepts.

#1. Operating System
 
  We could choose between two operating systems: Debian or CentOs. I chose *Debian* because it is more user-friendly and has a wider community than CentOs, that is commonly used by big enterprises as it is supported by Red Hat.
 
#2. LVM Partitioning

  Disk partitioning was made manually, following the subject's structure. We had to use *Logical Volume Manager*, or LVM, which allows us to dinamically partition a disk, based in Physical Volumes (PV's), Volume Groups (VG's) and Logical Volumes (LV's).
   The subject gives us two structure options:
   One for the mandatory part:

   And another one for the bonus part (the one I chose):
